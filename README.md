# HCA_Kinase_Analysis

This repo has the code I've written to take a first pass at quantifying the kinases present in the [Human Cell Atlas Preview Data Sets](https://preview.data.humancellatlas.org]). I've only looked at the human data that has already been processed to the point that we have counts of mRNA reads mapped to human genes, so the bone marrow and cord blood data sets.

Both of my reports on the kinases present in these data sets are viewable on github: [bone marrow](https://github.com/IDG-Kinase/HCA_Kinase_Analysis/blob/master/bone_marrow/analyze_bone_marrow.md) and [cord blood](https://github.com/IDG-Kinase/HCA_Kinase_Analysis/blob/master/cord_blood/analyze_cord_blood.md).
